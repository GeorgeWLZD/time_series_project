## 1. Business Case

ABC company operates in the telecom industry in an emerging market. The company so far has focused all its marketing efforts on offline **flyer advertising** and online **Google AdWords**. However, recent performance reports showed that ABC’s sales have not been reaching the management’s expectations. The CMO, in preparation for a meeting with the CEO and CFO wants to **answer these questions**:

- Q1: What would be the **forecast of demand** for the next 12 weeks?
- Q2: What are the **drivers of sales** in the long run? What is the **contribution** of each marketing action to sales?
- Q3: To what extent do AdWords and flyers **impact sales** in the short versus long run?
- Q4: How should ABC allocate **marketing budget** between AdWords and flyers to get the best results?

## 2. Data Structure

We have the historical weekly sales and marketing expenditure on flyer advertising and Google AdWords advertising spend over a **time span of 122 weeks**. Here we have a **glimpse of the first 10 rows** of the dataset:
